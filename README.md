Time-series analysis is interesting, however forecasting with time-series data can be challenging. 
Some points to keep in mind while dealing with time-series:

1) The uncertainty of forecast is just as important as the (point) forecast itself.
2) Model serving (deploying & scoring) is really tricky.
3) Cross-validation (with sliding or expanding window as testing strategy) is also tricky.

Subway uncertainty is the uncertainty of known unknowns; events can be predicted assuming a window of uncertainty. It's like even on a worst day or trying to navigate rush hour train, your subway voyage almost definitely won't take you more than around 30 minutes plus planned time.

Coconut uncertainty is an allusion to a coconut unexpectedly falling on oneâ€™s head while on a beach. It's the uncertainty of unknown unknowns; events that could never have been predicted no matter how hard we tried.
